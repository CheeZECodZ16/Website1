    <h1>Design in detail</h1>
    <p>Hello, it is me again. Today, I want to talk about building this website. It wasn't that much work, and I built it in about 5-6 hours. And for the posts,</p>
    <p>This website, I actually got inspired to make it by a youtube video (Link to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXfFBEuCAr0&t=92s">video</a>). And it wasn't that hard, I used <a href="https://www.programiz.com/html/online-compiler/">programiz</a> to make the website (it is an online IDE). Then I asked <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/">microsoft copilot</a> (it's free) to make a basic template. I put that in the IDE then edited some text.</p>

		<p> In all fairness, I did have some background coding in html from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a> (which I reccomend taking their first course in their cirriculum which is responsive web design). But if i didn't know anything I would use <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/">copilot<a /> or just search it up.<p /> 
    <p> Also it did take a bit of work to find the right font, but I found a really usefull <a href="https://www.cssfontstack.com/">font list </a> and that helped for finding them. I also used a color wheel (I don't remember which one, but just search up "hex color wheel" and the number with the # before it is the one you will use.<p />
    <p>Finnaly, the moment you all are waiting for, how much did it cost? Well nothing acually. I didn't have to pay anything. All the tools I linked are free, and I hosted it using github pages. Eventually, I might buy a domain, but not yet. If you want to learn more about hosting with github pages, the video I linked earlier tells you how to make the entire website.</p>
    <p> Edit: I found two problems with the programiz editor, first it kept crashing, and seccond the buttons woulden't work in it. So I did some searching, and found a <a href="playcode.io">new one</a>. This one works way better also it has a learn section. But the learn for HTML looks like the freecodecamp one.</p>
