    <h1>Chase Wright</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
  <p>My Name is Chase Wright. I <b>LOVE </b> electrical enginering and coding. I will talk about coding and electrical enginnering on here. I know a lot of people think that coding is <b>Hard </b> but it isn't as hard as people expect.<p/> 
    
  <p>This website, I acually got inspired to make it by a youtube video (Link to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXfFBEuCAr0&t=92s">video<a>). And it wasn't that hard, I used <a href="https://www.programiz.com/html/online-compiler/">programiz<a/> to make the website (it is an online IDE). Then I asked <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/">microsoft copilot<a/> (it's free) to make a basic template. I put that in the IDE then edited some text. <p/>
    
  <p> In all fairness, I did have some background coding in html from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp<a> (which i reccomend taking their first course in their cirriculum which is responsive web design). But if i didn't know anything I would use <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/">copilot<a/> or just search it up.<p/>
